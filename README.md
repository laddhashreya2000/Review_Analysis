# Review_Analysis
As e-commerce and these online services are becoming more
and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows
rapidly which gives rise to the need to automating the process of reading the re-
views and drawing meaningful summaries from the reviews which would help not
only the customers to make decisions on whether to buy the product but also to the
manufacturer to know exactly what all things need to be improved in the existing
product and which ones to prioritize. <br/>
In this project, we implemented and extended some of the existing works
on feature extraction and sentiment analysis for better and more informative
summarizing. We firstly extract the one word features from a set of reviews based
on their frequency of occurrence followed by association rules mining to get a list
of two of word features by examining the words that occur frequently. This is fol-
lowed by sentiment analysis of each and every feature to get an overall sentiment
of a particular feature. We do not summarize the reviews by selecting or rewriting a subset of
the original sentences from the reviews to capture their main points as in the classic
text summarization. In this work, we only focus on mining opinion/product features
that the reviewers have commented on.
