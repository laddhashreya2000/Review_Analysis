  PLZZ read this complete information before buying from AmazonThey do not refund if your product got defected.Amazon is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy from Flipkart then go there. Don't waste your time on AmazonRegarding mobileWorst mobile i have ever seenBattery charging time is more than expected.Battery drainaing problem is thereCamera will stuck when you click pictures.Poor camera quality they said 48 mp but it's like 12mp.  If you are game lover then PLZZ try another mobile. Performance is very low.I told Amazon customer care to take this product back but they are not helping me instead they want me to go service center in covid19 situation which is in red zone. They can't provide home visit because their technician life is more important than customer. If customer get infected it's ok for them.Thanks Amazon for this service now i hate Amazon more than tiktok.Unistalling the app right now. And also recommending my friend's and relatives to not buy anything from Amazon, they are worst.

  Hi all,As I have bought redmi note 9 pro on first sale, I would like to share my review on this.I would give  you my honest experience..I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons  of this phone,1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 2 hrs.2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than this 48 MP, Night mode is not good enough,Its just a hipe,clarity has to be compromised,Even front camera is not good, pics get blurr by zoom. Same here samsung M30 again have gain..So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of redmi note 9 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.6.sound is average,So it's my honest feedback after using it for 4 days. I really feel disappointed.( In battery, camera, display, Sound)Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best.Thanks üëç

  Bought Redmi Note 9 Pro (Interstellar Black) in 1st sale, using it extensively. Read my review, if you are planning to buy one.EDIT: 1. Updating review for using more than a month, facing some strange battery drain issue, battery is not lasting even for a day. Once, fully charged, it automatically gets decreased by 5-10% without doing anything.2. For daily usage screen size feels too big, not easily manageable, also device is bulky.--------------------------------Pros:1.  48MP Quad Camera (with Samsung GM2 Sensor) captures amazing pictures, both outdoor as well as indoor.- Even in low light conditions, photo looks cool.- Selfie looks more natural, not over beautification like oppo,vivo.2.  6.67 inch FHD+ dot display looks good.3.  Dedicated Memory card slot.4.  5020 mAH li-polymer battery - it easily lasts for more than a day with average usage.- With 18w charger, it takes less than 2 hrs for full charge.5.  P2i splash-proof nano-coating6.  Notification LED7.  IR Blaster*NavIC for navigation, but haven't noticed any difference than GPS.Cons:1.  60 Hz display (vs 90 Hz display of Realme 6) : Difference is noticable, while playing games.2.  For PUBG, RN9Pro frame rate setting limited to Ultra, on other hand, Realme6 supports up to Extreme.In short, Gaming is better on Realme 6 with MediaTek G90T.Final Verdict: If you want device with better battery performance, Redmi Note 9 Pro is gold choice.- For better display & gaming experience, get Realme 6.*Will edit review, after using few more days.

  This phone promises lot but gives very less.Most Importantly 48mp option in camera modes.I didn't find much difference in normal mode and 48mp mode. Sometimes photos taken by 48mp are noisy, 48mp mode doesn't work well when strong ambient light present.Other issue is Google assistant. I tried many times to wake assistant with command Ok google, but it doesn't work only. I've set up everything in assistant which is essential to use voice assistance, but no usePlease don't feel heart broken, so far these two are the only drawbacks I found but I must say battery is just wow. With one full charge phone last almost 2 days with normal use. I was surprised. Camera also works well for 13k mobile. Except 48mp mode, maybe due to some software issues.

  The way youtube took us by storm by claiming it to have a solid and premium build quality. I was amazed. But soon after I ordered and received the product, I realized that the screen has a gradiant grey shading from the bottom. The glass quality doesn't look like the ones we have in premium phones. I wonder if Corning Gorilla Glass is also made as per grade and different rates. To sum it up you get a considerable product better go for Samsung M21 and thank me later.

  Writing this after a three day useTo start with uniqueness, the quad camera setup, NavIC, side mounted fingerprint sensor, haptic feedback, glassy finish all the factors makes the phone pretty cool.Camera - The phone produces very good images using the 3 sensors(depth, macro, wide) according to customisation along with the primary 48mp shooter. The image produced will be highly dependent on factors like light exposure, camera handling, mode selected etc. Video recording is available with EIS & 30 and 60fps. There is an option to record videos with movie scope. Overall 4.2/5NavIC - The ISRO developed positioning system adds more accuracy while navigating. I really liked it and its our country's technology. 5/5Design - The phone is packed with almost all sensors, no issues. The glassy finish, front and back gives the phone a premium look. Comes with Gorila Glass 5 protection in 3 layers. 4.5/5Dedicated external memory slot - no need to buy a 128gb variant fearing the limited storage, can expand storage upto 512gb. 5/5Network reception - i witnessed a commendable hike in download speed, so the NW reception is very good. 5/5MIUI - Yes there were some preinstalled stuff which can be uninstalled easily. About the annoying ads and notifications, they could be disabled with some settings(available on many internet blogs). There where some minute bugs, which i'd expect to be sorted out with the next UI update. 3.8/5Notch - The user can manage how the punch hole cam could appear according to his desire. I dont like to hide it, as it looks good for me. 4/5Processor - RAM - The qualcomm snapdragon 720g with 2.3ghz clock speed makes the phone more reliable and very smooth. The RAM was able to retain the cache of previously opened apps for a noticeable amount of time, so switching between the apps now and then is not an issue the Processor and RAM pulls it off easily. 4.3/5Speaker - earpiece - Both sound outputs are commendable. 4.3/5Type c USB & 3.5mm headphone jack - Type C cable along with 18w charger, charges the phone within 2 hours from 10% to 100% without any heating issues. 33W adapter can obviously charge the device even faster, but it's not provided in the box. 4/5Battery - With a whopping 5020mah battery a moderate user can use the device for more than 1.5days with one time full charging. 5/5Notification light - It was nice to see the notification light available. After stuffing so many sensors they did not forget to add that, appreciate that. 5/5Gaming experience -  I'm not a mobile gamer, so refresh rate is not a concern to me. Still the qualcomm snapdragon 720g processor can easily handle games like PUBG or COD with HDR graphics.I havent faced any kind of heating issues nor lags while using the camera.Overall it's a very good phone, for this price range it is packed with commendable features and no compromise with the sensors.

  The only thing I like about the phone is the side mounted fingerprint sensor. It's even faster than my Samsung tab s5e.Now comes the bad parts...1. As has been pointed out by other customers, Internet download speed is very slow (never reaches 2Mbps). My 4 years old Lenovo downloads the same file at 4Mbps using the same service provider at the same time.2. I'm not much into ""Mobile Photography"" but the picture quality is horrible. It becomes better with camera apps from Play Store(which doesn't give me control over the three other non primary lenses)3. This is my first time using an MI phone and the ads are annoying af. Can't turn them off too.4. The gesture controls are very uncomfortable. They can learn this from samsung.5. I don't know if this has happened to anyone but I actually ordered the black variant but was sent the blue one. It's written as ""Interstellar Black"" on the box but inside was the blue one.Overall, I'm disappointed. I gave it to my sister and I'll be buying another phone.

  Writing this review after 7 days of usage.Giving 4 star because of better battery life expectations, and also that MIUI needs to be cleaner (using for the first time. Was a stock android user since long). Other specs of the phone are fine.Delivery Experience - Great by Amazon. Couldn't recieve it quicker with all the lockdown that's in place nationwide. Recieved within 4 days or ordering.Battery life - Average. I am using the phone extensively, with regular music and light apps. Turns out that the battery lasts 1.5 days. I expected more.Camera - Good. You might find pictures getting hazy but I recieved a software update 2 days before (after 4 days of usage), and since then, the picture quality has been good. Picture quality has been good in all camera modes.Display - Good. Better than expected.Fingerprint Sensor - Takes a little time for unlocked screen to appear after you put your finger. Could have been better. No problems with the location of the fingerprint sensor.Heating Issues - No heating issues in phone whatsoever. Charger gets heated after 1 hour of charging or so.Performance - Good overall. No lags experienced.Charging speed - I could charge my phone from 0-100% in around 2 hours 25 minutes.MIUI - A lot of useless apps would be pre-installed. Half of them can't be uninstalled. MI Browser is bad. I would suggest to go to Apps->Default Apps and change few of those. Sliding up from home screen opens up the MI Browser. You can easily disable from settings.Note - Please disable the Dynamic Wallpaper Carousel. It eats up a lot of battery. By default, it's activated.Works well after the above cleanings.

  Great device in budget, we should not expect much in 14k. Rest of the things are perfectly working except fingerprint reader which is misbehaving once in a while (Negligible). I hope MI will resolve this with updates.Camera: Works great except in low light(AI is smoothing the image quality while Processin)Battery: It's the USP of the device, working perfectly.Gaming: PubG in balanced Ultra works great if you have a good speed of internet on your device.UI : It's good but not the best, lots of third party apps needs to be uninstall, showing belly dancing videos in preferred results(I don't know why? SMH)Connectivity: Perfect, way better than my Honor 9 lite. Earlier I was getting 28 mbps and now it's 43 mbps on the same wifi. Calls are good too.Conclusion: If you are on budget of 15k max, just go for it. You won't get a better device in that budget.

  After Using this Phone for a Month,This is My Personal Review.Overall Review:- One of the Best smartphones in the price range of 14000‚Çπ-17000‚Çπ.Phone Specs:- Snapdragon Processor makes it function like a flagship phone.The Performance is Ultra Smooth and no lag is noticed even while continuously playing PUBG for too long.Camera: Camera Quality is quite impressive.The Colors are Vibrant. but the software could have been better since it is 64 Megapixel camera.Battery: It is Not up to my expectations,I am a heavy user so 100% Battery works for 7-8 hours for me.Display:- Beautiful display (90/100)Cons:-1)Heating issue is there while gaming for longer duration.2)Camera Software as mentioned above.3)Glass body on the backside is too weak and can easily be broken after slight damage.

  Even though it's called interstellar Black it looks blue.The display is vivid, vibrant, colourful.Side mounted fingerprint reader is pretty fast.Camera quality is good and clicks photos quickly.The glass back is great to look, and hold, but it's a fingerprint magnet.IR blaster works great, the TV guide option in the Mi Remote app is helpful.The power button/fingerprint reader is a bit hard to press, but there's option to wake screen on lift or double tap to wake.The phone is thick, wide, heavy, and tall. If you're looking for a compact phone look elsewhere (compare dimensions with other phone), it's hard to use it single handedly.

  #Mi Note 9 proI used this phone for approximately 10 days and here's my review:The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast. I usually don't prefer indisplay fingerprints in budget segment phones(p.s. they are not very fast). Given the price, the specs are literally awesome. The camera module is innovative.

  ### IN SHORT ###Overall great phone. I had a lot of problems to purchase this one, Amazon‚Äôs delivery OTP problem and many other problems due to lockdown. Screen issues got fixed automatically, but there are bugs in camera, music player, volume, UI which I hope will be fixed in future updates.### IN DETAIL ###The phone got very hot on first charge, and after charging it started having screen bleeding(a very clear neon glow like bright line on the edges of the screen when seeing something dark grey) and image retention (screen burn, especially of time and battery bar and navigation buttons) issues. I fixed the image retention by changing the color scheme settings from Default to Cool and Auto.But a few hours later I updated to latest April2020 patch (there was no mention of screen issues in the update) and then both the screen issues were gone. I changed from Cool back to Default, still no problem.The second charge did not heat up the phone. So either the screen problems were caused by overheating from the first charge which went away when the phone cooled down, or the OTA update fixed it.Everything else is great. No major issues so far. Interstellar black looks gorgeous, but with the given black cover it looks almost fully black. I'm not a gamer, but I played PUBG lite and a few other games, and they were fine.### NIGHT MODE PROBLEM ###Normally night mode images on phone's camera app is great, but sometimes it makes the dark areas grey, which looks bad. Gcam doesn't do that, so it's definitely a software bug and probably will be fixed. Gcam takes better but slower and more detailed night images, Phone's camera takes sharper and faster but less detailed night images.BUGS I FOUND:1. Face unlock not working flawlessly because front cam not able to open sometimes2. camera app couldn‚Äôt open a few times, fixed after restart or clearing cache3. night camera can be way better with better processing cause gcam takes much better night photos, though gcam takes more time to shoot and process images4. pictures with flash come highly overexposed and washed out, or the photo comes out as if no flash was used, and this only happens with the primary camera, not the wide lens. VERY STRANGE5. sometimes downloading apps from play store gets stuck at ‚Äòwaiting‚Äô6. sometimes after unlocking, the phone shows only wallpaper and nav buttons, but the home screen appears when I press the home button, not a big deal but still a bug.

  Ok so, this is a honest review. Plz don't go for the 4gb ram. This phone is probably built for 6gb ram. Coz it's slow. I got the 4gb, actually wrong product color as I ordered black, I got blue. The camera is actually amazing. But the phone is reeeeeeeallly sloooow. After unlocking the apps load so slow it's annoying and really sad that such a good specs phone sucks so much. So I'd say don't go for the 4gb one. And I haven't used the 6gb variant so I donno if it's slow too. But mine is really irritating. Not happy. But the camera is bomb and that I can't deny. Fingerprint reader is also fine, Not as good as realme sensor but it's fine.

  Will directly start with pros and consPros1. Processor: it is fast. Those who say Pubg lags, ignore them. It doesn't even heat much even after playing long. So heat dissipation is very good.2. Design: every time I open it's cover, it's just beautiful, interstellar black looks very premium. Last time I had this feeling, only with my iPad. The gorilla Glass protection üîí is a premium add on.3. Battery: this is the biggest advantage of this phone. Though most redmi devices provide a great battery üîã, this phone is way ahead of most. With normal use, it may go upto 2 days!4. Display: it's great! Sharp, viewing angles are great! Gaming experience is awesome5. Other: Call quality is great. Default redmi keyboard works fine, just have problem with Indian language input. MI remote (this is also a differentiator, and a point for strong recommendatiom of this phone).Cons1. The area around notch has a small burn, so i keep my phone's notification bar hidden (through setting) most of the times.2. Without cover, it is bit slippery through hands3. The proximity sensor works weird sometimes, while on call4. Video recording is good with 60fps only. Front recording is not so good. Picture quality in good lighting is nice, but not in low light settings. I have seen the realme phones or even redmi note 8 has a way better camera.Cons are not the dealmakers or breakers. You should definitely buy the phone.

  I would like to give five stars to the product. Great job Xiaomi. This phone is a complete package. As per the price range, you will get lot more than you expected.Pros:1. Amazing battery backup: Contains a huge 5000 mah battery so it's obvious to have good battery backup.2. Great camera quality: 48MP Quad camera is decent. All modes are working supers. Video recording quality is also superb.3. Performance: It contains Qualcomm Snapdragon 720G processor plus 4Gb RAM. Amazing performance and no lagging at all.4. Display: 6.67-inch FHD+ full-screen dot display gives immersive watching experience to the users. But only on YouTube why I will explain in the cons section.Cons1. Weight: The phone is a little bit bulky, you can literally feel the weight.2. Sound: Sound is not good but it's okay not a big problem.3. You can not enjoy Full HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. Its a software bug. I hope Xiaomi will fix it.

  I am very unhappy with Amazon and Redmi as they are supporting black marketing.While trying to order this phone for the last 3 sale seasons , I observed that within 5-10 seconds showing deal was 100% claimed and join wait-list is full.But this phone is available in other cell phone retail shops with 1000-2000 price extra. How come those shops are getting multiple phone stocks while people here are struggling to order the phone.I request the people to support my review 'helpful' who faced similar kind of experience such that other people don't waste their time and money in ordering this phone.

  I have recently switched from a samsung phone to Redmi and these are my reviews:Fingerprint lags if any app was left opened before locking your phone.Camera stopped working. Be ready for this error most of times you are trying to open the camera.Video calls will get stuck and a black screen will appear due to the camera issue.Camera quality is not that great as compared to samsung.Phone is thick and bulky and the camera portion extends out too far. This is prone to scratches so buy a cover together with the mobile.

  Great phone by Xiaomi.Good Processor, Nice Battery backup too but camera quality and proformance can be improve. Display is okay...Amoled display can be better instead of IPS LCD. They increased height to make bigger display but instead, they could make it wider.  Punch hole camera could be better and smaller too. Ads can be block through settings and adguard. Those who want to increase its'performance try some tweaks like turn off background data of each app, battery saving at 40 percent, disable automatic synch,use gcam for redmi devices(marlin ku , jairo rossi etc developers), adguard 3.1,ProCam and manual camera for video Shooting (video Shooting settings-1512p at 8mbps,2160p at 15mbps, iso or white balance +0.33 or 0.17.)Such tips surely help you.Overall, it is big bang for you buck.

  Amazing and one of the best phone under 15K segment. Display is above average.

I bought 4GB varient. But it gives decent performance at all. Camera is outstanding. Overall I like this phone and highly recommend for all under 15K price segment.
